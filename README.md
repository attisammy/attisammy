My journey started with a Bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science, fueled by an obsession with solving puzzles and asking ‚Äúwhat if an attacker tried this?‚Äù. That curiosity grew into a craft ‚Äî the craft of a Threat Hunter. Today, Azure is my playground and I roam it with my trusty tools: PowerShell, Python, and KQL. With them, I hunt for adversaries, trace their footprints, and turn their tricks into new defenses. 

Along the way, I‚Äôve armed myself with certifications ‚Äî CompTIA Network+, ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC), and CompTIA Security+ ‚Äî not as badges, but as milestones in the fight to sharpen my skills. This GitHub is where my stories live: simulated breaches, investigations, detections, and the lessons I‚Äôve carved out of every hunt. It‚Äôs proof that persistence, creativity, and a bit of stubbornness can turn curiosity into a weapon. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Vulnerability Management And DISA-STIGs Implementations

Vulnerabilty Management is the ongoing process of finding, prioritizing, fixing, and re-checking weaknesses in systems before attackers exploit them, and DISA STIGs (Defense Information Systems Agency ‚Äì Security Technical Implementation Guides) are like rulebooks for computers used by the U.S. military and government. Think of it this way: if your house had valuable secrets inside, you‚Äôd want to lock the doors, add cameras, and make sure the windows can‚Äôt be forced open. 

STIGs are the official checklist of those ‚Äúlocks and alarms‚Äù ‚Äî but for computers, servers, and networks. They tell system administrators: what settings to tighten, what features to disable, and how to make sure hackers can‚Äôt easily sneak in. In this porject, I audited a company's IT infrastructure security posture and implemented solutions. And in the process ensured that their host machines are DISA compliant. Check them out:

## üö® Threat Hunting and Security Operations

Threat Hunting is like being a detective in the digital world. Most security tools are like alarms ‚Äî they go off when a break-in happens. But alarms don‚Äôt always catch everything. Threat hunters are the detectives who don‚Äôt just wait for alarms ‚Äî they actively look for clues that someone might be sneaking around. They dig through computer ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù (like logs, patterns, and activity) to spot things that don‚Äôt belong ‚Äî kind of like noticing muddy boot prints on a clean floor. Threat Hunting is the practice of searching for hidden cyber-intruders before they can cause damage. Here are some Threat Hunt that I have done:
