# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akpoebi-atti-691447373/">Akpoebi Samuelson Atti</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

I‚Äôm currently serving in the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Machinist Mate (AD), specialized in the maintenance of F/A-18E/F Super Hornet engines (F414-GE-400). 

I enjoy the processes of making sure that these birds are ready, equipped, and safe for flight before the pilots walk and get into the cockpit. There is no greater feeling of relief and accomplishment every time I see a smile on the pilots‚Äô faces when they return home from their missions. 

However, as the end of my Navy Active Duty contract approaches - August 2027, I yearn to return to my first love (IT). Especially the area of ensuring that your virtual business environment (be it cloud or on premise) is safe, secure, and available for your customers to safely conduct transactions. 

At the moment, I am available to work part time with your business or company if you are looking to hire someone to help access, recommend, and implement/improve your business/company's security posture. 

Until then, the following certifications and knowledge base is how I keep myself up to date in the field of cybersecurity.

- CompTIA Security+
- ISC2 CC
- CompTIA Network+

üí° Current Focus
